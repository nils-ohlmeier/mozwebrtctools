manual call
===========

These two simple pages establish a WebRTC call between two Firefox browsers.
The first browser opens the offerer.html page. After that the second browser
opens the answer.html page.
The pages depend on exchanging their SDP via a simple signaling server, which
you can get from here https://github.com/luser/simplesignalling.git
